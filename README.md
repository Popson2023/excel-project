# SALES ANALYSIS PROJECT USING EXCEL 
This project was done to help identify customer preferences, popular toppings, and peak ordering times, enabling the store to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies for increased profitability.
* The project is about sales in a given XYZ company and giving useful insights to help increase productivity and profitability.
* Sales are transactions between two or more parties in which the buyer receives tangible or intangible goods, services, or assets in exchange for money. In some cases, other assets are paid to a seller.

## Steps taken to make this project a success
* Data Collection: Gathering relevant sales data from various sources, such as line of business, point-of-sale systems, customer databases, and online platforms.
* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring the data is accurate and consistent by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and organizing it for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical and visualization techniques to gain initial insights into the data, such as identifying total revenue by region, total revenue by rank, total revenue by day category etc.
* Performance Metrics: Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales growth, customer acquisition, and retention rates to measure the success of the sales efforts.
* Visualization: Creating clear and compelling visualizations in tools like Excel to communicate findings and insights to stakeholders.
* Recommendations: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis and suggesting strategies for improving  total sales revenue, pricing, marketing, and inventory management.

## Insights and recommendations
* From the above visualization, we can notice that the North-east region has the highest revenue of regions for which sales were made the most in the regions. I recommend that areas like North-central focus more on their sales growth by bringing up innovative strategies like doing a certain amount of discounts on the goods and services. 
* From the above illustration, It's seen that the sales revenue for March to May for the two years were quite more profitable which is a good idea to get more goods available for the period to sell more.
